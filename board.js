// This file contains the code to draw the board.
/*
    The board is a 5x5 grid. This will be represented in the code as a 2-dimensional list.

    [
      [3, 3, 4, 3, 3],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]
    ]

    Where 1 and 3 are each player's small pawns, 2 and 4 are the king pawns.
