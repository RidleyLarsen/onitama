// This file contains code to draw the game pieces and move them.
/*
    Things that game pieces can do:

      * Move, using one of the cards on your side of the table.
      * Capture a piece by moving into it.
      * Enter the winning space.
      * After clicking on a piece, the piece will ask the cards what spaces they
        can move to, then ask the board to highlight those spaces.
